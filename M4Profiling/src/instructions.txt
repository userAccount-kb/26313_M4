After viewing the tutorials mentioned in the Learning Materials page on VisualVM 
and JProfiler, choose one of them, and install it. Use it to profile the following 
program:

Write a Java application that does the following. The Main method should:

Call a new method which adds 2,000,000 random integers into an ArrayList, then 
deletes each one from the ArrayList

Call a new method which adds 2,000,000 random integers into a LinkedList, 
then deletes each one from the LinkedList

Call a new method which adds 2,000,000 random integers into a Hashtable, then 
deletes each one from the Hashtable


Pseudocode: 
Main {
    Call randArrayList
    Call randLinkedList
    Call randHashtable
}

randArrayList {
    for loop (2M iterations)
         add random integer to ArrayList
    Output ArrayList size for confirmation
    Clear ArrayList
}

randLinkedList {
    for loop (2M iterations)
         add random integer to LinkedList
    Output LinkedList size for confirmation
    Clear LinkedList
}

randHashtable {
    for loop (2M iterations)
         add random integer to Hashtable
    Output Hashtable size for confirmation
    Clear Hashtable
}
